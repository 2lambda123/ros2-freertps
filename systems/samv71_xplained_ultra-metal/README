when we have more than one board with this chip, we'll need to factor this 
library into a SOMETHING_common library and a board-specific library, like
is done for, e.g., {stm32_common, stm32f4_disco-metal}

also, we can probably unify a lof general ARM stuff into an arm_common
or an arm_cortex_m_common or something like that, since the cmsis and other
scripting stuff is typically identical (or almost identical).

since i haven't yet been able to program this using OpenOCD, this is all
currently broken. it's a work in progress. Once OpenOCD has a driver for this
chip, we'll revisit this port.
