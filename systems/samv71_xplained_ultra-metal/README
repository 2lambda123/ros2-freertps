when we have more than one board with this chip family, we'll need to 
factor this library into a SOMETHING_common library and a board-specific 
library, like is done for, e.g., {stm32_common, stm32f4_disco-metal}

also, we can probably unify a lot of general ARM stuff into an arm_common
or an arm_cortex_m_common or something like that, since the cmsis and other
scripting stuff is typically identical (or almost identical).
